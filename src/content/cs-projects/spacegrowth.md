For this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of space missions using programming skills and data visualization techniques. The motivation behind this research was to explore trends in space exploration in an environmental lense to see the effects the space industry has on Earth. 

To achieve this, I utilized **Python** for data processing and analysis, leveraging libraries such as **Pandas** for data manipulation and **Plotly Express** for interactive visualizations. The research involved collecting historical mission data, cleaning and structuring the dataset, and performing statistical analysis to extract meaningful insights. Then, I did extensive research on different environmental trends and studies to gather evidence and information on the environmental effects of the space industry. 

The findings of this project are documented in detail in the attached files, where you can explore both the research paper and an interactive analysis of space missions. Feel free to interact with the embedded files below to dive deeper into the data and insights.
